% this is the previous function hmdbn_score_family_all_diffgammanologm()
% [score tempCPD]= hmdbn_score_family_all_diffgammanologm(j, ps, ns,  data,SeedSampleDistribution)
% SeedSampleDistribution is the p(O, G|hmdbn), where hmdbn is the nonstationary network with only two networks composed of two nodes i and j.
% The two networks, one is only one node j and the other network is node (i and j) and edge i -> j.

% 1. this function identifies the putative hidden graphs according to SeedSampleDistribution;
% 2. according to SeedSampleDistribution,set the initial p(O, G|hmdbn) for each putative hidden graph;
% 3. function hmdbn_fwdback() further modifies the transition matrix; (specific putative hidden graphs may be removed)
% 4. acorrding to the above results (transition matrix and hidden graphs), calculte the BWBIC score.
